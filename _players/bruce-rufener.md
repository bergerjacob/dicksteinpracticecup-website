My connection with bowling started in high school, and I bowled a lot for about a year, until getting distracted by other interests, such as skiing, tennis & golf. From then on, I rarely bowled until I was 64 years old, when  my wife & I went out to dinner with some friends and later visited Kellogg Bowl to have some fun. The excitement in me was re-kindled and I set out to become a as good a bowler as I could be. 

I spent many a day at Kellogg (Greg can attest to that) practicing by myself in pursuit of that elusive “300”. I did finally roll my first perfect game on July 2nd, 2019 at 66 years of age (you’re never too old!). Somebody finally talked me into joining a league and I have been happily engaged in the sport, trying to improve and making new friends at Milwaukie Bowl. 

I am forever grateful to the Husted family for being such welcoming hosts for our beloved “Practice Cup”. I appreciate all of you who I’ve come to know as part of my bowling family. I am a believer in Jesus Christ and I try daily to practice the grace that He has for all of us. As Greg would say, Gooood luck & Goooood Bowling!!
