I started bowling in 1980 with Precision Castparts League at 82nd Bowling Alley. 

I moved on to Milwaukie Elks and Kellogg Bowl around 1982. Tuesday and Wednesdays then added Milwaukie Bowl on Thursdays for a single season around 1984?

Eventually I dropped The Elks and Milwaukie Bowl and remained at Kellogg Bowl on Wednesday KP Commercial League and Fridays Mixed League.

I bowled regularly until the end of the eighties got married in 1987 (still married) and had children. 

Married life, children, and shift changes at Precision Castparts made it increasingly hard to stay bowling and less important. I was at PCC for almost 42 years.

I started bowling regularly again in January 2025 where I have met some wonderful folks to share my enjoyment of this challenging game.
