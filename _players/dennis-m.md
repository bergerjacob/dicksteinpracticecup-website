My wife Laura and I moved to Lake Oswego from the Bay Area in 2023 after retiring from our careers at the end of 2022.

I began bowling as a junior bowler at age 7 at Cloverleaf Family Bowl in Fremont, California. From age 7 until my mid 20's I was a very active bowler and competed in both handicap and scratch leagues and was part of a competitive travel league during my high school years. 

My one and only sanctioned 300 game came in a tournament when I was 15, and while I have come close several times, I have not 'cracked that nut' a second time in league or tournament play. 

I took a long hiatus from bowling until about 6 years ago when my wife and I joined a mixed league in the Bay Area. After moving to LO in 2023, we were fortunate to discover Milwaukee Bowl and all of the wonderful people associated with it. I feel very fortunate to have found a bowling alley and made friends that encourage me to be my best bowler and my best self.
