I started bowling about 20 years ago. It was the usual, a friend needs someone to fill in at league. I started with house balls and house shoes, then got my own plastic ball and shoes, ... a couple of decades later, I come to the alley with four balls and am already trying to figure out how I can bring more and not have it be too obvious (or annoying) that I am. Of course, because if I had better equipment or the lanes were better oiled, I would bowl so much better. ;-) (BTW, if anyone knows of a ball that can get my 10-pin conversion percentage above 75%, please send my way!) 

Anyway, I enjoy Milwaukie Bowl for the lanes, and more importantly, for the people! It's a privilege to have been invited to participate in the Dick Stein Practice Cup. Please remember, if I don't shoot 600+, it's because of the equipment or the lanes. ;-)
