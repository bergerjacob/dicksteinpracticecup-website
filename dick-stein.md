<h1>Who the Heck is Dick Stein??</h1>

    <p>Some people say, “He walks softly and carries a big stick”, but I would beg to differ- he does NOT walk softly!</p>
    <p>Dick Stein is the official monitor, regulator, recorder, slanderer and otherwise harasser for the Practice Cup events.</p>
    <p>Still, he has been a great mentor for all of us, offering words of wisdom such as , “Second ball first”, “Try 17 & 18” or “Don’t hit the pocket” after a 7-10 split. Over his career, he has won tournaments playing both right and lefthanded.</p>
    <p>Having bowled most of his life, he is quick to share stories of past exploits despite the fact that we have absolutely no interest in hearing them. He rarely plays these days due to health conditions, instead devoting most of his energy reading paperbacks and hurling occasional expletives our way. Oh, a word of advice: If you ever have the opportunity to go to the Margarita factory with him and his sister, Carol- I would decline. Let’s just say they love their “flights”.</p>
    <p>So, that said, this is the man we have deemed to name our vaunted Cup after. Why? I have no idea.</p>
