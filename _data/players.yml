      This is Terry Dodson and here’s a little bit about me. I consider myself
      to be a 64 year old rookie when it comes to bowling. I retired at 62 after
      working a total of 35 years on the waterfront as a longshoreman/crane
      operator. Prior to that, my last experience in league bowling was at about
      age 10. Needless to say, I did not know much about bowling. It’s not as
      simple as most people would believe - and to be good, you need practice,
      experience, correct technique and equipment. That was apparent immediately
      as I thought I could be a decent bowler right away. I couldn’t have been
      more humbled after finishing the one league I was in - my first year with
      a 153 average… Swallow your pride dude…

       As a kid, athletics came very easy to me. I played pretty much every sport and was always competitive and always very confident. In 1975 I set the national record in the high jump at 6’1 1/4” at the age of 13. I went on that summer to compete in the AAU NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS and beat everyone thus becoming the 1975 national age group champion. An accomplishment I’m very proud of. People who knew me from school, know me for that. In high school I cleared 6’6” at the Oregon State high school championship meet only to watch 2 other guys clear 6’8”. It was clear to me then that I wasn’t really built for the next level of 7’(plus) high jumpers so that was it for my high jump career.

        Bowling has been very humbling. People at all ages can be (and are) very good. You don’t necessarily need to be a Michael Jordon type athlete to kick tail in bowling. It’s a whole different animal and I truly love it!  I mean, who doesn’t like the sport of bowling? It’s fun and you can be competitive into your 90’s as I have witnessed first hand from guys like Jerry Hastings. I’d like to say thanks to you Bruce, for being supportive and encouraging to me since we met. I thank you for giving me guidance on various balls to purchase - it has been very helpful and very much appreciated and also, thank you for inviting me to compete in the Practice Cup! I’m far from being able to win against the great bowlers you’ve assembled but it’s very fun to compete. I am watching closely and trying to become a better bowler!
